# hello-world
This is the normal traditional beginners program in programming
My name is Amako Joy Ugochi, I'm a software developer and graphics designer.
I started coding in my first year in the university and since then I have enjoyed every bit of it.
I add value to my life everyday by learning one new thing
Last year, my laptop got damaged but that didn't stop me from coding.
I borrow laptops from friends to practice.
Its not easy but my passion keeps me going and makes me stronger everyday.
